# About
A private general-purpose Discord bot made to organize the Discord server of a volunteer activities club.

The bot is hosted in an Azure VM.

# Commands
You can check the available commands in the `src/commands` folder.

# Improvements
The bot is not developed to be reusable for other users because it is tightly coupled to work in just the [GDSC Discord server](https://discord.gg/24VKKDyDh7), so this could be a future refactor.
